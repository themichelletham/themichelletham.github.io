  i had the opportunity to work at bank of america's global technology & operations division in 
  global information security. this was my first exposure to working at a financial corporation
  as well as learning cyber security. our intern project was to gameify cyber security education modules
  for employees to learn how to secure their data. our game "cyber clue" placed first in the intern competition.
