  i attended <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/summer-immersion-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">girls who code's summer immersion program</a> at pfizer inc.
  here, i learned the fundamental computer science skills in various programming languages -- scratch, python, arduinoc, and html/css.
  as a final project, i built an unofficial <a href="http://youtube-store.glitch.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">youtube store</a> to connect youtube communities
  through creators' merchandise.
