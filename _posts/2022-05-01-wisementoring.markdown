description:
---
during the last two years of my college experience, i was so so lucky to have the oppoturnity to mentor two groups of seven freshmen students
in the women in science and engineering honors college. while i helped them navigate through their first year of college and the cs major,
i learned how hardworking these women are and how they can crush it when they join the tech industry
