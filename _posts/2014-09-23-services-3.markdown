  i attended [girls who code's summer immersion program](https://girlswhocode.com/summer-immersion-programs/) at pfizer inc.
  here, i learned the fundamental computer science skills in various programming languages -- scratch, python, arduinoc, and html/css.
  as a final project, i built an unofficial [youtube store](http://youtube-store.glitch.me/) to connect youtube communities
  through creators' merchandise.
