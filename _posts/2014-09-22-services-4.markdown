  i volunteered at [united east athletics association's fun fun saturday summer program](https://www.ueaa.org/fun-fun-saturday/) in nyc's chinatown as an instructor
  for building computers, web development, and volleyball classes. while trying to make our classes as engaging, resourceful, and "fun-fun," i wanted to also inspire the
  young boys and girls to chase their passions. seeing their eyes light up when their websites run with a heartwarming gif, or scoring a point in our practice volleyball
  games, was the highlight of the program :)
